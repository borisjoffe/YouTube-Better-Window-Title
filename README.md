Youtube Better Window Title
=============================

### Install from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/450646-youtube-better-window-title)

Features
--------
- Quickly view YouTube video length in minutes (rounded) and Channel Name in the tab name so you don't have to switch tabs to browse through and sort your youtube (works great with tab manager extensions too)
- When double-clicking on the video date, copy a wiki link (compatible with zim-wiki) to the clipboard to make it easier to add video references in PIM system
- When enabled (via the extension menu), automatically expand comments and load more comments
- When enabled (via the extension menu), quickly report Spam comments - when clicking the comment dropdown, the extension will automatically click "Report" for you and automatically select the "Spam" option. You will still have to manually click the button to submit your report


Known Issues
------------
When navigating from a non-video page (e.g. Home, Subscriptions), the script may not run. If the title doesn't appear within 5-10 seconds, refresh the page
